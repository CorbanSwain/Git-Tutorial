# Getting started with Git and GitHub

## Creating A GitHub Account
*You'll need a GitHub account to use Git most effectively, if you already have
an account, great! You can skip this step.*

1. Point your web browser to [github.com/join](https://github.com/join).
2. Enter your information and follow the on-screen steps to create an account.

## Local Installations

I'll be asking you to install both a command line tool __and__ a visual tool for
working with Git on your computer. Below are instructions for the three major
operating systems.

### Windows

#### GitHub Desktop - Visual Tool

1. Point your web browser to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Download GitHub Desktop and open the windows installer. Follow these [instructions for instalation](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/#platform-windows).

#### Git Bash - Command Line Tool

1. Point your web browser to [git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
2. Open the `.exe` download and follow the on screen instructions for getting things set up. All of the default options

### Macintosh

#### GitHub Desktop - Visual tool

1. Point your web browser to [desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com/).
2. Download GitHub Desktop and open the `.dmg` file. Follow these [instructions for instalation](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/#platform-mac).

#### Git - Command Line tool
*Your mac is a Unix-based operating system so you may already have Git
installed, otherwise you'll need to install XCode and Mac Command line tools
to get it running.*

##### Testing for Git
Open your Terminal application and type `git`, then press Enter.

If you see something like this:

```
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           <command> [<args>]

These are common Git commands used in various situations:

```

... then git is already installed. You can stop here.
